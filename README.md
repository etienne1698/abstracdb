# SaladORM

SaladORM is a lightweight abstraction layer for data access in JavaScript applications. It provides a structured way to interact with data models and relationships while remaining database-agnostic. 
SaladORM itself is not intended to be used directly but rather through a specific database implementation, such as VueDatabase.
