# AbstracDB

AbstracDB is a lightweight abstraction layer for data access in JavaScript applications. It provides a structured way to interact with data models and relationships while remaining database-agnostic. 
AbstracDB itself is not intended to be used directly but rather through a specific database implementation, such as VueDatabase.

## Installation

Install AbstracDB via npm:

```sh
npm install abstracdb
```
